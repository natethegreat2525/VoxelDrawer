# Voxel Editor

Voxel Editor is made with my 3d block engine and uses a simple JSON based format for storing voxels. The vox files can be loaded into the block game engine as voxel based entities.

## Controls:

- The prompt at the beginning is for the workspace size x, y, z.
- Mouse - rotate camera
- WSAD - move left right, forward, back
- Shift - move down
- Space - move up
- Left click - place block
- Right click - delete block
- Middle click and drag - fill volume
- E - color picker for block currently being looked at
- Q - wireframe
- Left clicking the save and open blocks saves and opens .vox files
- U - undo
- Escape - exits not saving any work
- Scrolling - scrolls through available colors (I would recommend just using the color pallette and the E button though)
- Cube in lower left - color currently selected
